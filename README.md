# MathProgram
A program to test math skills.

I would recommend expanding the Readme if you hope to get the attention of possible users.
I found this collection of example readme's for inspiration: https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme

You can made yours as simple as you want by imagining what a new user would need to know before using your game.  I recommend at least tell them the purpose of the game (why should they want to use it, probably in your case including learning objective so they know if they are the intended user), the technical requirements (written for python2 or 3, etc.), and the installation and "getting started" instructions so they are able to run the program without any assumption of knowledge of the terminal.  Readmes can be written using markdown, so you can make links, add screenshots and code snippets, etc.  They can be quite fun and quite silly (observe: https://gist.github.com/eed3si9n/3920236 (although I would include more helpful info in the dialog myself))
